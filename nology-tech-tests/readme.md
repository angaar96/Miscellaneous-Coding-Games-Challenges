# _Nology Tech-tests

This is a collection of Junior Software Developer tech tests. The aim is to give you exposure to a wide variety of technical assessments. 
Each Test is from previous student so they are real world examples of what you might get. 
Take each test with a pinch of salt e.g. you could use react instead of angular etc.
<br> I will be posting my solutions in this repository. <br> 
The repository containing the challenges can be found [here](https://github.com/nology-tech/tech-tests).
