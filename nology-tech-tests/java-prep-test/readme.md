# Java Prep Test


Using Java 11, write code (with tests that correctly validate it) to complete the following two problems:

1. Given a list of integers, find the two largest integers and return them.

2. Given a HashMap<String, Integer> of student full names and their test scores (1 - 100),
find the following answers:

a. The average test score
b. The highest test score
c. The lowest test score

You may not use complex in-built methods, such as .sort()!

Best of luck!
